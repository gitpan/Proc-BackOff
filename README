NAME
    Proc::BackOff

SYNOPSIS
    Usage:

     use Proc::BackOff::Linear;

     my $obj = Proc::BackOff::Linear->new( { slope => 5 } );

     while ( 1 ) {
         # delay will return
         #      0 : No delay needed.
         #      N : or the number of seconds until back off is completed.

         sleep $obj->delay() if $obj->delay();
             # or
             $obj->sleep();

         if ( do_attempt() ) {
             # success
             $obj->success(); # passing success to Proc::BackOff will reset
                              # Proc::BackOff
         } else {
             # failure
             $obj->failure(); # passing failure will instruct Proc::BackOff to
                              # increment the time to back off
         }

         # 100 failures in a row, time to exit
         die "complete failure" if $obj->failure_count() > 100;
     }

     $obj->reset(); # reset back the same state as it was new.

DESCRIPTION
    Proc::BackOff is a base module meant to be directly inherited from and
    then modified by overloading the calculate_back_off object method.

    Use: Proc::BackOff::Linear, Proc::BackOff::Random, or
    Proc::BackOff::Exponential.

    Any success "$obj->success()" will result, in the back off being
    removed.

METHODS
  new()
    This is for internal use only.

    Do not call this function, call new from: Proc::BackOff::Linear,
    Proc::BackOff::Random, or Proc::BackOff::Exponential.

  delay()
    Delay will return the following

        > 0, number of seconds until the delay is over
        0 delay is up.  Meaning that you should do your next attempt.

  sleep()
    This is a short cut for:

        sleep $obj->delay() if $obj->delay();

  success()
    Success will clear Proc::BackOff delay.

  reset()
    Simply just resets $obj back to a state in which no "backing off"
    exists.

  failure()
    Failure will indicicate to the object to increment the current BackOff
    time.

    The calculate_back_off function is called to get the time in seconds to
    wait.

    The time waited is time+calculated_back_off time, however it is capped
    by $self->max_timeout().

  valid_number_check()
    Is this a number we can use?

    1 1.234 'count'

    are valid values.

  calculate_back_off()
    Returns the new back off value.

    This is the key function you want to overload if you wish to create your
    own BackOff library.

    The following functions can be used.

    * $self->failure_count()
        The current number of times, that failure has been sequentially
        called.

    * $self->failure_start()
        When as reported by time in seconds from epoch was failure first
        called

    * $self->failure_time()
        When was the last failure reported ie, $self->failure() called.

    * $self->failure_over()
        When in time since epoch will the failure be over.

  backOff_in_progress()
    returns 1 if a back off is in progress

    returns 0 if a back off is not in progress.

    The difference between backOff_in_progress and delay() > 0, is that at
    the end of a timeout, delay() will return 0, while the backoff will
    still be in progress.

  max_timeout()
    Subroutine automatically created by mk_accessors.

    Get $obj->max_timeout()

    Set $obj->max_timeout( 60*60 ) ; # 60 * 60 seconds = 1 hour

    The Maximum amount of time to wait.

    A max_timeout value of zero, means there is no Maximum.

  failure_time()
    Subroutine automatically created by mk_accessors.

    When was $obj->failure() last called? Time in seconds since epoch.

    Get $obj->failure_time()

    This variable is not meant to be set by the end user. This variable is
    set when $obj->failure() is called.

  failure_over()
    When in seconds since epoch is the failure_over()?

    This is used internally by object method delay();

Inheritance
    I have included an exponential, linear, and random back off. You can use
    any of these sub classes to make a new back off library. Please consider
    sending me any additional BackOff functions, so that I may include it
    for others to use.

Notes
    Please send me any bugfixes or corrections. Even spelling correctins :).
